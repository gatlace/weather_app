# Weather App
(I hope nobody expects me to name these projects creatively)

## What is it?
It's a simple weather app that I made using React and two APIs: \
    [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com) \
    [Teleport](https://developers.teleport.org)

## Features
- Weather forecast for the next 7 days
- Search for a city
- Save cities to local storage
- Change measurement units

## How to run it
- Install React and the dependencies \
```npm install```
- Run the app \
```npm start```
- Build the app for production \
```npm run build```
